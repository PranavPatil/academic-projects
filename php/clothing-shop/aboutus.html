        <p>Asali Clothing is a wholly owned subsidiary of Asali Co, Inc. Asali's experience in the retail fashion 
industry is derived from over twenty-five years in operating retail clothing businesses focusing primarily in the 
junior and petite apparel markets. Cornerstone is driven by the same ownership and management team responsible 
for prior successes in retailers Everblue Casuals and Career Image. In Papaya, we've created a more contemporary, 
upscale shopping environment for customers in the 16 to 25 age bracket.</p>

<p>Our stores are stocked with the latest fashion direct from the manufacture. Since we are a manufacturer-direct store,
we do not commission any middlemen and can therefore transfer our savings directly to the customers. Our customers know 
that they can shop any day of the year rather than lower their standards or wait for sales at other retailers. In essence, 
we've created a shopping environment that will attract customers and keep them coming back on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Asali's Apparel, Inc. has an impressive track record with retail businesses. We expect that trend to continue. It's 
this kind of phenomenal success that allows Cornerstone to head strongly in to the new millennium and focus all of our 
efforts into the development and expansion of Papaya retail locations. </p>
