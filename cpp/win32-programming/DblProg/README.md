Populates it with X random integer values, between 0 and MAX in value, where X and MAX are taken from the command line:
�dblprog 20 40� would create a linked list with 20 random values in the range 0-40.
Prints the list out forwards and then in reverse
Demonstrates inserting a value 31337 in position 7, and printing the list again. Use class for this.
