Create a mini taskmanager like program to list all processes currently running and try to show as much details about every process as you can.

Easily create a simple application which enumerates all the processes on a machine. You may use a command-line application if you wish, or a GUI. Print out as much information about each process as you can.
This looks really nice in .NET� but that�s a little more tricky.
Calling � CLI is okay.
