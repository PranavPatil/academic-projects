Create a simple program which calculates the prime factors of a given 32-bit unsigned int
However… you may use a maximum of 3 threads in your program
And the entry/answer thread must always remain responsive
Output must be printed VERTICALLY… if there’s more than 20 lines, you should pause and wait for keyboard input
At no point when both threads are waiting to output should you be using CPU time – everything should be in the WAIT state.
