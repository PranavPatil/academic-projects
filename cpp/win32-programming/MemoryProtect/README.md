Create a command line program in Visual Studio
Write an application which allocates memory and tries different protection schemes
Show how the system throws exceptions when you access this memory (for example, try and execute code from the memory location when PAGE_READONLY is set)
Use an exception handler to catch this exception
Reset the PAGE to EXECUTE and show how the exception is no longer thrown…
